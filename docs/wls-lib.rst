Wls Lib Overview
================

The Wls_lib is a Wireless Service library that supports shared memory and buffer management used by applications 
implementing a gNb or eNb. 
This library uses DPDK, libhugetlbfs and pthreads to provide memcpy less data exchange between an L2 application,
API Translator Module and a L1 application by sharing the same memory zone from the DPDK perspective.

Project Resources
-----------------

The source code is avalable from the Linux Foundation Gerrit server:
    `<https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/gitweb?p=o-du%2Fphy.git;a=summary>`_
    
The build (CI) jobs will be in the Linux Foundation Jenkins server:
    `<https://jenkins.o-ran-sc.org>`_

Issues are tracked in the Linux Foundation Jira server:
    `<https://jira.o-ran-sc.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa>`_

Project information is available in the Linux Foundation Wiki:

Library Functions
-----------------

* **WLS_Open() and WLS_Open_Dual()** that open a single or dual wls instance interface and registers the instance with the kernel space driver.
    
* **WLS_Close(), WLS_Close1()** closes the wls instance and deregisters it from the kernel space driver.

* **WLS_Ready(), WLS_Ready1()** checks state of remote peer of WLS interface and returns 1 if remote peer is available.
    
* **WLS_Alloc()** allocates a memory block for data exchange shared memory. This block uses hugepages.

* **WLS_Free()** frees memory block for data exchange shared memory.

* **WLS_Put(), WLS_Put1()** puts memory block (or group of blocks) allocated from WLS memory into the interface for transfer to remote peer.

* **WLS_Check(), WLS_Check1()** checks if there are memory blocks with data from remote peer and returns number of blocks available for "get" operation.

* **WLS_Get(), WLS_Get1()** gets memory block from interface received from remote peer. Function is a non-blocking operation and returns NULL if no blocks available.

* **WLS_Wait(), WLS_Wait1()** waits for new memory block from remote peer. This Function is a blocking call and returns number of blocks received.
    
* **WLS_WakeUp(), WLS_WakeUp1()** performs "wakeup" notification to remote peer to unblock "wait" operations pending.

* **WLS_Get(), WLS_Get1()** gets a memory block from the interface received from remote peer. This Function is blocking operation and waits till next memory block from remote peer.

* **WLS_VA2PA()** converts virtual address (VA) to physical address (PA).

* **WLS_PA2VA()** converts physical address (PA) to virtual address (VA).

* **WLS_EnqueueBlock(), WLS_EnqueueBlock1()** This function is used by a master or secondary master to provide memory blocks to a slave for next slave to master (sec master) transfer of data.

* **WLS_NumBlocks()** returns number of current available blocks provided by master for a new transfer of data from the slave.

The **_1()** functions are only needed when using the WLS_Open_Dual().

The source code and documentation will be updated in the next release to use inclusive engineering terms.
