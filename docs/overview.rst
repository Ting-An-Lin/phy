Front Haul Interface Library Overview
=====================================

The O-RAN FHI Lib is built on top of DPDK to perform U-plane and C-plane functions according to the 
ORAN Fronthaul Interface specification between O-DU and O-RU.
The S-Plane support requires PTP for Linux version 2.0 or later.
The Management plane is outside of the scope of this library implementation.


Project Resources
-----------------

The source code is available from the Linux Foundation Gerrit server:
    `<https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/gitweb?p=o-du%2Fphy.git;a=summary>`_
 
The build (CI) jobs will be in the Linux Foundation Jenkins server:
    `<https://jenkins.o-ran-sc.org>`_

Issues are tracked in the Linux Foundation Jira server:
    `<https://jira.o-ran-sc.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa>`_

Project information is available in the Linux Foundation Wiki:
    `<https://wiki.o-ran-sc.org>`_


ODULOW
------

The ODULOW uses the FHI library to access the C-Plane and U-Plane interfaces to the O-RU. 
The FHI Lib is defined to communicate TTI event, symbol time, C-plane information as well as IQ sample data.

DPDK
----

DPDK is used by the FHI Library to interface to an Ethernet Port
The FHI Library is built on top of DPDK to perform U-plane and C-plane functions per the ORAN Front Haul specifications

Linux PTP
---------
Linux PTP is used to synchronize the system timer to the GPS time
