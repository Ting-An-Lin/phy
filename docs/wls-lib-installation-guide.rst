Wls Lib Installation Guide
==========================

The wls library uses DPDK as the basis for the shared memory operations and requires that DPDK 
be installed in the system since in the makefile it uses the RTE_SDK environment variable when
building the library. |br|
The current release was tested using DPDK version 19.11 but it doesn't preclude the 
use of newer releases. |br|
Also the library uses the Intel Compiler that is defined as part of the ODULOW documentation.

Overview
--------

This document describes the wls DPDK base library for ODULOW to ODUHIGH
communication as part of the |br|
ORAN Reference Architecture where an intermediate
shin layer can be present between these components.


================================================================================


Building and Installation
-------------------------

Retrieve the source files from the Linux Foundation Gerrit server:
    `<https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/gitweb?p=o-du%2Fphy.git;a=summary>`_

1. cd wls_lib
2. wls_lib$ ./build.sh xclean
3. wls_lib$ ./build.sh

The shared library is available at wls_lib/lib

This library is used by the ODUHIGH, shin layer implementing a 5G FAPI to IAPI translator and the 
ODULOW components.

Please define an environment variable DIR_WIRELESS_WLS with the path to the root folder of
the wls_lib as it is needed for the fapi_5g build process.

Unit Test building and validation
---------------------------------

In order to build the unit test do the following steps:

1. cd test
2. ./build.sh xclean
3. ./build.sh
4. Create an SSH session into the target an change directory to wls_lib/bin/phy
5. issue ./phy.sh
6. Create a second SSH session into the target and change directory to wls_lib/bin/fapi
7. issue ./fapi.sh
8. Create a third SSH session into the target and change directory to wls_lib/bin/mac
9. issue ./mac.sh

After the test run you should see that each module sent and receive 16 messages from
the display status messages.

================================================================================



Known Issues/Troubleshooting
----------------------------
No known issues.
For troubleshooting use unit test application.
